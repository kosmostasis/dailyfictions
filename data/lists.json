    "description": "Cahiers du cin�ma is an influential French film magazine founded in 1951.  \r\n\r\nThe magazine has picked its top ten films of the year, most years.  Top ten films were not picked in the years 1952-1954, 1969-1980, and in the year 2003.  Rankings can be viewed in my source list URL, or via the link provided in the comments section.  In some cases, films tie for a certain spot in the yearly top 10; for example, 2012's #4 spot is tied between three films (consequently, there is no #5 or #6).  Some directors definitely appear to be heavily preferred by those responsible for selecting the list.\r\n\r\nThis list does not include the special \"best of 1990s\" and \"best of 2000s\" decade lists, though most of those twenty films are included here.  (The exceptions are David Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks on the 1990s list, and Gus Van Sant's Elephant, Abdellatif Kechiche's The Secret of the Grain, and Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds on the 2000s decade list.)\r\n\r\nOther anomalies:\r\nThe TV show \"24\" tied for the #10 spot in 2002, along with Gus Van Sant's Gerry.  Gerry also tied for #6 on the 2004 list.\r\n\r\nA TV episode \"Travolta et moi\" (dir. Patricia Mazuy) from the show \"Tous les gar�ons et les filles de leur �ge...\" was selected as #6 in 1994.  Claire Denis' episode \"US Go Home\" from the same series rated #9 in 1994.\r\n\r\nRaul Ruiz's Les trois couronnes du matelot (Three Crowns of the Sailor) tied for #7 in 1983 and tied for #8 in 1982.\r\n\r\n1968's #4 spot for Histoires extraordinaires is specifically for Federico Fellini's segment \"Toby Damnit.\"\r\n\r\n1965's #4 spot for Paris vu par... is specifically for the Jean Rouch episode.\r\n\r\n1959's #3 spot was claimed by Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.  Since Part II was released in 1958, it is possible that the award was for Part II, but since my sources didn't specify a part and both parts may have been shown together, I have included Parts I & II in the list.\r\n\r\nLove it or hate it, here it is...\r\n\r\n[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_du_cin%C3%A9ma%27s_Annual_Top_10_Lists]Source[/url]",

And more recent dazzling recent such as Charlotte Wells' aching coming-of-age tale ?Aftersun? and Molly Branning Walker's prickly, ambiguous ?How to Have Sex? are pushing the medium into bold, bracing new territory.\r\n\r\nIn compiling this list of the best British movies of all-time, we surveyed a diverse array of actors, directors, writers, producers, critics and industry heavyweights, including Wes Anderson, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Sam Mendes, David Morrissey, Sally Hawkins, Thandiwe Newton and the late Terence Davies.

According to Vogel--founder of Cinema 16, North America's legendary film society--the book details the \"accelerating worldwide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored.\" So ahead of his time was Vogel that the ideas that he penned some 30 years ago are still relevant today, and readily accessible in this classic volume. Accompanied by over 300 rare film stills, Film as a Subversive Art analyzes how aesthetic, sexual, and ideological subversives use one of the most powerful art forms of our day to exchange or manipulate our conscious and unconscious, demystify visual taboos, destroy dated cinematic forms, and undermine existing value systems and institutions.\"\r\n\r\nThis list contains all movies in the revised version from 2021.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this list are movies:\r\n1. with dedicated texts.\r\n2. shown in movie stills.\r\n3. mentioned otherwise as an example of subversive cinema in the context of the text it is mentioned in.\r\n\r\nExcluded from this list are movies that are mentioned in any other way than an example of subversive cinema.\r\n\r\nThe movies are sorted by appearance in the book. Some movies appear multiple times. In that case, the preferred position is the dedicated text, then a movie still and lastly a mention.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into parts:\r\nIntroduction (#1 - #20)\r\nPart 1 - Weapons of Subversion: The Subversion of Form (#21 - #170)\r\nPart 2 - Weapons of Subversion: The Subversion of Content (#171 - #355)\r\nPart 3 - Weapons of Subversion: Forbidden Subjects of the Cinema (#356 - #572)\r\nPart 4 - Towards a New Consciousness (#573 - #598)\r\n#599 is the back cover.",

Advances in film technology (sound recording, lighting, special effects, cinematography and use of color) meant that films were more watchable and 'modern'. The films themselves took on a more realistic rather than escapist tone, as they had done during the Depression years of the 30s. The 40s also were the decade that saw the birth of a new genre in film noir (\"black film\") pared with  the revival of gangster films.",

    "description": "\"Since its explosion in the 1950s, science fiction has become one of the most popular film genres, with numerous dedicated fan conventions, academic conferences, websites, magazines, journals, book clubs, memorabilia and collectibles. Once relegated to B budget status, today's science fiction films are often blockbuster productions, featuring major stars.\r\n\r\nDespite its high profile, science fiction is notoriously difficult to define. In his introduction to 100 Science Fiction Films, Barry Keith Grant explains the genre's complexities, while also providing an overview of its history, suggesting that the cinema is an ideal medium for conveying the 'sense of wonder' that critics have argued is central to the genre. From Georges Melies's Le Voyage dans la lune (1902), to the blockbusters of the 1970s that dramatically changed Hollywood, to the major releases of the past few years, the films featured in this book represent a range of periods, countries and types (including alien invasion, space travel, time travel, apocalypse, monsters and anime), and cover the key directors and writers.\r\n\r\n100 Science Fiction Films provides a lively and illuminating guide to the genre from the beginning of film history to the present, taking the reader on a comprehensive tour through the rich and varied alternate universe of sci-fi cinema.\"\r\n\r\n[url=http://shop.bfi.org.uk/100-science-fiction-films-book.html#.Wg3hHmhSzIU]Source[/url]",

    "description": "Establishing the best anime movies can be tricky. After all, despite now being one of the most ubiquitous cultural properties of the 21st century, anime, thanks to over a century?s worth of the medium?s evolution and reinvention, is especially difficult to define. From the five-minute shorts of Oten Shimokawa in 1917, to the feature-length animations produced during World War II, to the pioneering production cycles of Tezuka in the ?60s and the auteurist innovations of the likes of Miyazaki and many others towards the latter half of the last century, anime has morphed through countless phases. Amateur efforts, nationalist propaganda fodder, niche cultural export turned eventual global phenomenon: Each iteration conforms to the shape of the times in which it was produced. Television expanded the medium during the 1960s, birthing many of the essential genres and subgenres that we know today and forming the impetus for the anime industry?s inextricable relationship to advertising and merchandising from the 1970s onward. The arrival of home video catapulted anime to its commercial and aesthetic apex, fanning outward from island nation of Nippon to the far shores of North America and back, before again being revolutionized by the unprecedented accessibility of the world wide web throughout the ?90s and early aughts. Anime film owes much to the evolving means of production and distribution throughout the late 20th century, the breadth and audacity of the medium?s content widening and contracting along with its running time to cater to the emerging palettes of audiences both new and old, at home and abroad. But where does one begin to tackle the aesthetic and historical precedent that anime film has left on pop culture and global entertainment in the last century?\r\n\r\nThis list is an attempt to do just that: to create a primer of 100 of the most influential and essential films that Japanese animation has produced, and to offer a thorough aesthetic, technical and historical breakdown of why these film matter. With that aim in mind, Paste is proud to enlist the curatorial talents of Jason DeMarco, on-air creative director of Adult Swim and co-creator of Toonami, whose unique role in anime?s emerging popularity in the West has helped to hone this list. Given the shared evolution between anime film and television and the aforementioned significance of the home video revolution, this list includes not only traditional features but also original video animations made for home video (OVAs) and anthology films? with the stipulation of each entry having at some point premiered in theaters. It is our hope that in creating this list we have created an entry point for both the expert and the layperson to trace the rich history of anime?s legacy on both film and popular culture, and to offer newcomers a comprehensive guide through to learn, rediscover, and explore the fullness that the genre of Japanese animation has to offer now and into the future.\r\n\r\nOriginally published in January 2017.

This led to the rise of the great studios and the construction of many movie theaters. It was also a decade of innovation, with both the technology and the medium itself. D.W. Griffith's epic Birth of a Nation in particular helped film-making make a giant leap forward. The most popular genres were westerns, melodramas and slapstick comedies.",

    "description": "\"?From the coming of sound to the 1960s, the musical was central to Hollywood production. Exhibiting ? often in spectacular fashion ? the remarkable resources of the Hollywood studios, musicals came to epitomise the very idea of 'light entertainment'. Films like Top Hat and 42nd Street, Meet Me in St. Louis and On the Town, Singin' in the Rain and Oklahoma!, West Side Story and The Sound of Music were hugely popular, yet were commonly regarded by cultural commentators as trivial and escapist. It was the 1970s before serious study of the Hollywood musical began to change critical attitudes and foster an interest in musical films produced in other cultures. Hollywood musicals have become less common, but the genre persists and both academic interest in and fond nostalgia for the musical shows no signs of abating.\r\n\r\n100 Film Musicals provides a stimulating overview of the genre's development, its major themes and the critical debates it has provoked. While centred on the dominant Hollywood tradition, 100 Film Musicals includes films from countries that often tried to emulate the Hollywood style, like Britain and Germany, as well as from very different cultures like India, Egypt and Japan. Jim Hillier and Douglas Pye also discuss post-1960s films from many different sources which adapt and reflect on the conventions of the genre, including recent examples such as Moulin Rouge! and High School Musical, demonstrating that the genre is still very much alive.\"\r\n\r\n[url=http://shop.bfi.org.uk/books/bfi-screen-guides/100-film-musical-book.html#.Wg3fhGhSzIU]Source[/url]",

As well as some of the major genres, stylistic approaches and exponents of cinematic fantasy - from Georges Me?lie??s, Walt Disney, and Andrei Tarkovsky to contemporary fantasists such as Terry Gilliam and Peter Jackson - this volume focuses on fantasy's social function with case studies including The Thief of Baghdad (1924), Excalibur (1981), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-03), and Bruce Almighty (2003). Taking in the popular and the experimental, subversive desires and reactionary dreams, this book is an accessible introduction to one of the vital energies in cinema.

In 1954, after facing much criticism about the whimsical nature of these awards, the Festival authorities decided to turn to a more traditional prize-giving arrangement. Since then, the Prix sp�cial du Jury reappeared only twice: Christopher Hampton won that award for Carrington along with the regular Prix du Jury given to Xavier Beauvois for Don't Forget You're Going to Die in 1995; and David Cronenberg won for Crash in 1996, which was the only prize allotted by the International Jury for that year.\r\n\r\nN.B.: In 2004, the Jury Prize was specially awarded to Irma P. Hall for acting in The Ladykillers, so the film is not included in the list here. Tropical Malady was also awarded the Jury Prize.",

    "description": "Seven years ago?when #OscarsSoWhite was a hot topic and Obama was still president?Slate published the Black Film Canon, a list of 50 of the best and most culturally significant films by Black directors. Critics, scholars, and the filmmakers themselves, including Ava DuVernay, Robert Townsend, and Gina Prince-Bythewood, weighed in with their picks. The result was a collection of films spanning almost 100 years, several continents, and a wide range of genres and styles: from Oscar Micheaux?s silent-era classic Within Our Gates to Djibril Diop Mamb�ty?s freewheeling road-trip movie Touki Bouki to F. Gary Gray?s iconic comedy Friday.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just months after the Black Film Canon came out, Barry Jenkins? Moonlight made history with a Best Picture Oscar win and Jordan Peele?s Get Out spawned a new cultural lexicon while reigniting the long-neglected Black horror genre. Just a year after that, Black Panther became an unprecedented box-office juggernaut. Since then, many other Black filmmakers, both seasoned and on the come up, have seized on an increasing number of opportunities to tell stories in bold ways: creators like Janicza Bravo, Boots Riley, and Garrett Bradley. Some adjudicators of cinematic prestige?like the once-a-decade Sight and Sound critics? poll and the Criterion Collection?have finally come around to acknowledging important Black filmmakers after decades of all but ignoring them. Simply put, we?re now living in a different world for Black film.\r\n\r\nYet, as ever, barriers remain. This year?s Oscars saw yet another nominations controversy. The forces that have worked to sideline Black filmmakers have not disappeared. Even as the landscape has shifted, there?s more power than ever in understanding the films that brought us to this moment and the new ones taking us into the future. So it seems only fitting to revisit the Black Film Canon and update it to reflect the rush of great movies that have arrived since 2016, as well as reconsider the films made before 2016 that we missed the first time around. This time, in partnership with NPR, Slate polled a group of experts?a mix of industry and critical authorities from our previous list, as well as some newcomers?and we?re thrilled to present the results in our New Black Film Canon. Use it as an opportunity to appreciate the breadth of artistry Black filmmakers have brought to the movies?and as an unbeatable viewing list deep with surprising treasures.\r\n\r\nThe project excludes movies about black people but directed by non-blacks (A Raisin in the Sun, Coming to America). It is also not a poll: it?s an unranked list presented chronologically.\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2016/05/the_50_greatest_films_by_black_directors.html]Original Source[/url]\r\n[url=https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/best-black-movies-directors-streaming.html]Updated Source[/url]",

    "description": "Romance may be dead in the real world, but in cinema, it?ll live forever. Love is simply too elemental of an emotion for filmmakers to ever abandon. If you live on earth, you?ve experienced it. Even if you?ve never, say, robbed a bank with your loved one or stood by your sweetheart as they transformed into a hideous monster, the best romantic films make you understand and sympathise with the decisions of those under love?s spell ? because one way or another, we?ve all been there.\r\n\r\nThere are so many movies about love in all its complications that ranking the greatest of them is a manor challenge. To help us curate this list, we chatted to more than 100 filmmakers, actors and writers, from The Notebook author Nicholas Sparks to Notting Hill director Richard Curtis to our own Time Out scribes. We even got Miss Piggy to chime in. Whether you prefer comedies or dramas, horror or sci-fi, we?re sure you?ll find the following list of the 101 greatest romantic movies ever speaks to your own heart as well.\r\n\r\nWritten by Cath Clarke, Dave Calhoun, Tom Huddleston, Catherine Bray, Trevor Johnston, Andy P Kryza, Guy Lodge, Phil de Semlyen, Alim Kheraj & Matthew Singer\r\n\r\nLast Updated: January 18, 2024\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.timeout.com/film/the-100-best-romantic-movies]Source[/url]",

This list, compiled by 240 experts including film researchers, critics, filmmakers, and industry professionals, is the third edition, following the 2006 and 2014 surveys. These editions allow us to trace the evolution of Korean cinema over the years. Particularly, they provide insights into the perspectives of film industry professionals who are at the forefront of advancing Korean cinema.\r\n \r\nA comprehensive survey was conducted for a three-month period from June 1 to August 31, 2023, encompassing a total of 100 Korean feature films. These films, spanning various genres such as fiction, documentary, animation, and experimental, were released through theaters, online platforms, and film festivals. The scope of the survey ranges from Turning Point of the Youngsters (dir. Ahn Jong-hwa, 1934) ? the oldest surviving Korean fictional film ? to those released up until December 31, 2022. To ensure that the survey results accurately reflect the perspectives of both viewers and industry professionals(makers), we are publishing two separate top 10 lists. The first list is compiled by 171 individuals who primarily 'watch' films, including researchers, critics, and film festival programmers. The second list is selected by those who 'make' films, encompassing directors, cinematographers, producers, as well as distribution and theater staff.\r\n \r\nWe hope that this list of 100 Korean Films will serve as a valuable resource for Korean film enthusiasts, offering insights into the evolving trends in Korean cinema and reflecting the dynamic changes in the film industry of Korean society.\r\n\r\nFinally, 100 masterpieces were selected.\r\nWe announce the top 10 lists and release other films in chronological order.\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/list/detail/242/0003]Full List Source[/url]\r\n\r\n- - - - -\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Korean Film Archive asked 62 film scholars, professors, critics and curators to vote for the top 100 Korean films.

Film school snobs may pretend to turn up their noses, but no matter how cultured you?d like to think you are, there?s a part of your lizard brain that loves explosions and shootouts and badass one-liners ? and it needs to be satisfied. \r\n\r\nBut action flicks needn?t be dumb, loud or graphic to succeed. Some find beauty in orchestrated violence. Others might crane-kick you right in the heart. Some even have ? gasp! ? character development. And so, to help put together this definitive list of the greatest action movies ever made, we reached out to some of the people who understand the action genre better than anyone, from Die Hard director John McTiernan to Machete himself, Danny Trejo. Pull the pin, light the fuse and batten down the hatches ? these are the most pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat thrill rides ever put to film. \r\n\r\nWritten by Eddy Frankel, Eddy Frankel, Yu An Su, Joshua Rothkopf, Trevor Johnston, Ashley Clark, Grady Hendrix, Tom Huddleston, Keith Uhlich, Dave Calhoun, Phil de Semlyen, Dave Calhoun and Matthew Singer\r\n\r\nThe list has 102 titles because Kill Bill was counted as one entry. \r\nLast Updated: Friday 13 September 2024\r\n\r\nModnote about list order: When Timeout changed the web formatting of the list from its previous pagination the ordering of each group of 10 got reversed, so we kept the list in it's original correct ordering.

    "description": "As a genre, the romantic comedy has had pretty sharply defined highs (the 1940s and 1980s) and lows (1990s-2000s) based on viewer appetite and studio competence, but thanks to this thing we call ?the human condition,? hope-laden fables showing how two people can, indeed, find and cherish one another despite all obstacles will never stay out of fashion long?no matter how soulless and cynical the industry. Whether because we are young and na�ve, not-so-young and searching, or old and grumpy with a soft spot (or wistful memory), there?s always an appetite for fascinating meet-cutes, resolved comedies of errors and melted gruff exteriors. So no matter your particular poison when it comes to scripted takes on love and relationships, let Paste?s list of the 100 Best Romantic Comedies of All Time provide you just what the doctor ordered.\r\n\r\nList published April 2013.

So we asked a group of award-winning Pixar filmmakers to help self-isolating families plan the very best movie nights (and days, and nights, and days?).\r\n\r\nWe asked a group of the renowned studio?s directors and story artists?the people behind WALL�E, Finding Nemo, Inside Out, Bao, La Luna, The Good Dinosaur, Purl, Cars 3, Toy Story 4 and more?to show up in your hour of need, and show up they have, with personal recommendations that we?ve split into three Letterboxd lists: All Ages, 7 to 12 Years and 12 Years and Over.\r\n\r\nFrom two-minute shorts to the entire Harry Potter collection, there?s something for every viewing window. From Charlie Chaplin to Greta Gerwig, the films cover a century of cinema; and from slapstick to horror, a multitude of genres.\r\n\r\nOur filmmakers were remarkably restrained, nominating more Studio Ghibli films than Pixar movies, though they collectively agreed that Toy Story should most definitely be there. So we?ll say it for them: please explore all the films of our contributing filmmakers: Angus MacLane, Domee Shi, Kristen Lester, Daniel Chong, Peter Sohn, Valerie LaPointe, Brian Fee, Enrico Casarosa and Andrew Stanton. Thanks, you wonderful people.\"\r\n\r\nThis list combines the first two lists that Letterboxd created with the Pixar directors, to present a selection of films suitable to watch with children under the age of 13. Some film series explicitly include all films in the series, even though only the first film is included in the Letterboxd lists (see their notes for more information): Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, and Harry Potter.\r\n\r\nIndividual lists on iCM\r\n[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/pixars+picks+family+films/fergenaprido/]Pixar Directors Recommend: Combined List[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/pixar+directors+recommend+films+for+families+all+ages/fergenaprido/]Pixar Directors Recommend: Films for Families (All Ages)[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/pixar+directors+recommend+films+for+families+7+to+12+years/fergenaprido/]Pixar Directors Recommend: Films for Families (7 to 12 Years)[/url]\r\n[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/pixar+directors+recommend+films+for+families+12+years+and+over/fergenaprido/]Pixar Directors Recommend: Films for Families (12 Years and Over)[/url]",

    "description": "Everyone has their favourite genre but we can surely all agree that thrillers are the best. And if you don?t believe us, there?s a suspicious figure in that darkened doorway who?d like a word. From the early classics, like Alfred Hitchcock?s The Lodger or Fritz Lang?s M, to the films of David Fincher and Martin Scorsese, they?re rich in nerve-shredding, adrenaline-pumping rides into the darker recesses of the psyche. Thrillers show us horrors and weave in human dramas, but they use those raw materials to forge something particular: a sense of unease and suspense. \r\n\r\nWith masterful control of those elements, Hitchcock could manipulate his audiences like puppets on a string, delivering shocks that reverberate through cinema history. Fincher?s Seven and Zodiac have carried on the legacy, while films like Pig, Nightmare Alley and The Card Counter show that the thriller is the genre for all eras. Even superhero flicks, like Captain America: Civil War and  The Batman, have been borrowing liberally from the crime thriller. It is, unlike many of its ill-fated characters, alive and well. \r\n\r\nBut what are the very best of them? As we?ve done with science fiction, horror films, romances, comedies, westerns and war films, we?ve dusted cinema for prints and taken a magnifying glass to its finest thrillers to boil them down to a tonne of all-timers. On the list? Murder, political intrigue, espionage, conspiracy, manipulation, gaslighting and, of course, crime. Lots of crime. Enjoy ? and hold on tight.\r\n\r\nWritten by Abbey Bender, Joshua Rothkopf, Phil de Semlyen, Tom Huddleston, Andy Kryza & Tomris Laffly\r\n\r\nList created in June 2018 (updated June 2021)\r\nLast Updated: March 23, 2022\r\n\r\n[url=https://www.timeout.com/film/best-thriller-movies]Source[/url]",

    "description": "In 2013, Filipino film blog [url=https://pinoyrebyu.wordpress.com/]Pinoy Rebyu[/url] invited around 200 film directors, screenwriters, critics, scholars, programmers, and archivists to send in a top 10 of their favourite Pinoy films. They received 81 ballots.\r\n\r\nThis top 100, published in 2015, is an expanded version of the original top 50 they published in 2013.\r\n\r\n[quote]When we conducted our 2013 poll for the Greatest Pinoy Films of All Time, 81 respondents (critics, filmmakers, archivists, academics, etc.) provided us with a total of 204 films, ranging from obscure gems like Kidlat Tahimik?s Orbit 50: Letters to My 3 Sons to the unabashedly campy No Other Woman. We decided then to limit the list to 50 because we had a lot of ties, and it seemed unwieldy to publish a top 100 list with so many ties.\r\n\r\nThat was before we discovered a sensible method to break ties based on which of the tied films are ranked higher by their respective voters. We have since used that method to rank the 100 Best Performances of the Half-Decade. It?s a pretty boring task to detail the equation we used (you can message us if you want to know how we did it) so let us get on with the more exciting job of revealing which films are the 50 next best.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[url=https://pinoyrebyu.wordpress.com/httpspinoyrebyu-wordpress-com20150731greatest-pinoy-films-of-all-time-nos-100-51/]Source[/url]",

Films of the period include beloved classics like Grand Hotel(1932) and King Kong(1933) but also lesser-known gems like I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang(1932) and Ann Vickers (1933). These films, produced at the height of the Great Depression, pushed the limits of contemporary social norms at a time when Hollywood studios were desperate to attract audiences?by any means necessary. Pre-Code Essentials invites modern readers to engage with that history while diving deep into movies that remain, as they were then, adventurous and uncompromising.",

    "description": "The Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television presents an annual award for Best Motion Picture to the best Canadian film of the year.\r\n\r\nThe award was first presented in 1949 by the Canadian Film Awards under the title Film of the Year. Due to the economics of Canadian film production, however, most Canadian films made in this era were documentaries or short films rather than full-length narrative feature films. In some years, a Film of the Year award was not formally presented, with the highest film award presented that year being in the Theatrical Short or Amateur Film categories.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, the Canadian Film Awards introduced an award for Best Feature Film. For the remainder of the 1960s, the two awards were presented alongside each other to different films, except in 1965 when a Feature Film was named and a Film of the Year was not, and in 1967 when the same film was named the winner of both categories. After 1970, however, the Film of the Year category was no longer used except in 1975, when due to the cancellation of the awards in 1974, it was presented alongside the Feature Film category as a de facto second Best Picture award, so that winners for both 1974 and 1975 could be named.\r\n\r\nAs of 1980, the award was taken over by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television and presented as part of the Genie Awards ceremony; as of 2013, it is presented as part of the Canadian Screen Awards.\r\n\r\nFilm of the Year: 1-9, 12, 14*-15, 17-18, 23-24*\r\nBest Feature Film: 10-11, 13-14*, 16, 19-22, 24*-27\r\nBest Motion Picture (Genie): 28-59\r\nBest Motion Picture (CSA): 60-onward\r\n\r\n[b]Warrendale[/b] & [b]Les ordres[/b] won both Film of the Year and Best Feature Film.\r\nN.B. At the 21st awards, no Feature Film Award was given out, but [url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/vertige-1969/]Vertige[/url] was awarded Best Film Over 30 Minutes, so it's sometimes considered to have won.

    "description": "Published March 30, 2020.\r\n\r\nWhen you grow up a sports fan, transferring that fandom from the backyard Wiffle ball game to the big screen at the local theater is a natural transition. We fall in love with movies that reflect our life experiences. We see our best friends in ?The Sandlot.? Or quote ?Happy Gilmore? relentlessly in the dorms. It?s why one person can find a movie like ?Field of Dreams? completely hokey while another turns to mush the moment Ray Kinsella?s dad pulls off his catcher?s mask and places it over his heart. We know what?s coming next.\r\n\r\nIt means our opinions of these movies vary wildly. Especially when you work at a media company with 400-plus employees who are all sports diehards. And opinionated. So in trying to determine the Top 100 Sports movies of all time, we decided to make the process as democratic as possible. That meant a lot of rules, processes and restrictions.\r\n\r\nFirst, we asked everyone on staff to nominate their favorite sports movies. This list quickly got unwieldy. Within days, it was 300 movies deep. It included movies people desperately wanted on the ballot where the only sport was, say, guys in jeans playing beach volleyball. Even with extra time on our hands, we didn?t want people rating 500 movies. So we made some rules.\r\n\r\nTo be considered, a movie had to be released in theaters at some point. That removed some really good television-only sports movies. (We?re looking at you ?[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/87724-brians+song/]Brian?s Song[/url]? and ?[url=https://www.icheckmovies.com/movies/121160-61star/]61*[/url]?.)  For documentaries to make the final ballot, the doc had to be released in theaters (no TV docs) and be at least nominated for an Oscar; or added to the Library of Congress? National Film Registry; or make at least $1M at the box office; or be culturally significant. Finally, with a small panel of movie enthusiasts, we culled the list to make individual calls on borderline sports movies. Is ?The Big Lebowski? really a sports movie? When things got tough, they went bowling. So we think it is. But there?s a good debate to be had about many others.\r\n\r\nNext, we asked everyone to rate as many movies as they?ve seen on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being best. You could give Rocky a 100 as well as Space Jam, if you so pleased. And why wouldn?t you?\r\n\r\nIn all, more than 120 panelists from The Athletic voted. The ratings were averaged out and sorted into the Top 100 below. To qualify for the final list, a movie needed at least 10 ratings from panelists.\r\n\r\nWe hope it gives some entertainment inspiration for any extra spare time you might have. And it?s just the start. All week, we?re rolling out sports movie-themed stories. From a technical breakdown of Adam Sandler?s tackling skills in ?The Waterboy? to an oral history of the best dog basketball movie ever made. It?s going to be fun. We hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\nGrab your popcorn. Here goes.\r\n\r\n[url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240822234957/https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1703442/2020/03/30/the-athletics-top-100-sports-movies/]Archived Source[/url]",
